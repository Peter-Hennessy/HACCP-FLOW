* Performance - How the page performs whilst loading.
* Accessibility - Is the site acccessible for all users and how can it be improved.
* Best Practices - Site conforms to industry best practices.
* SEO - Search engine optimisation. Is the site optimised for search engine result rankings.

### _I found doing this in Incognito browser window, gave a more accurate result with backing interferance_

### Peer review
In addition to the above testing the beta version of the site was put through its paces by peers, both in the software development field and outside. The results highlighted responsive design weakness for a type of mobile device that was rectified with minor CSS amendments. There were also minor spelling and grammar errors that have since been fixed.
