The site was also tested using [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in Chrome Developer Tools to test each of the pages for:

- Performance - How the page performs whilst loading.
- Accessibility - Is the site accessible for all users and how can it be improved.
- Best Practices - Site conforms to industry best practices.
- SEO - Search engine optimisation. Is the site optimised for search engine result rankings.

### _I found doing this in Incognito browser window, gave a more accurate result with backing interference_

### Peer review

In addition to the above testing the beta version of the site was put through its paces by peers, both in the software development field and outside. The results highlighted responsive design weakness for a type of mobile device that was rectified with minor CSS amendments. There were also minor spelling and grammar errors that have since been fixed.
