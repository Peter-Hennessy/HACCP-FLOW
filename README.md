# My very first website

Welcome! [Code Institute] (https://codeinstitute.net)
The idea for my project comes from a business idea I am currently in the process of trying to create.
It is a cloud based digital food safety management system that is tailored to meet the needs of the individual.
The design I have decided to go with is a clean, clear, simplistic platform. Which is relatable to my company idea.
Day 1: Following the guidlines from the love running project I created a basic structures
With no experience in this field I referred back to the HTML/CSS fundamentals which were very helpful in setting out my structure and design
Day 3 and I deleted my CSS file in error, which was not backed up, so had to restart the styling (lesson learned "git push" more!!)
Once basic Nav elements and body structure were in place the background image was chosen, which took time, as the correct image had to reflect the ethos of my company
Using the free website as recommended in the tutorials I used https://www.pexels.com/ and to fit to the screen size I used https://www.nchsoftware.com/imageconverter/index.html
In the Main image then a cover text was applied with the statement of the comapny where the "focus is on flow rather than disruption", and annimation was added to draw the image to the clients attention
This was very challenging but again through following the tutorials I was able to apply the desired styling
Also used google platform which directed me to https://www.w3schools.com/ and also https://stackoverflow.com/ which helped considerably and https://slack.com/
Again using the Love Running Examples I created a #Promise section to outline what my company can do with the statement "Let us work with you"
Outlining how the company can be beneficial and can make the taking and storing of Haccp Data hassle free and with minimal
Each statment has a heading and Font-awesome icon and a brief overview of the what is offered and how
