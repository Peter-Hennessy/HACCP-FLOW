# HACCP-FLOW

## Welcome to <a href="https://peter-hennessy.github.io/HACCP-FLOW/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HACCP-FLOW</a> a digital food safety platform

The idea for my project comes from a business idea I am currently in the process of trying to create.
It is a cloud based digital food safety management system that is tailored to meet the needs of the individual.
The design I have decided to go with is a clean, clear, simplistic platform. Which is relatable to my company idea. 
The concept for my project is a company i am in the process of creating, It is a company concieved through my own work practices as a head head & market study with over 50 of my industry peers to design a cloud based digital food safety paltform

# User Stories
- As a user I want to be able to see the main webpage heading first
- As a user I need to be able to see clearly where i want to go
- As a user I need to be able to see text and images clearly 
- As a user I need to be able to contact the company with relative ease
- As A user I need the page to load efficently to add to the user experience

# Wireframes
# [Insert Wireframe images here]
- For the wire frame design I chose to have the main information on a singe scroll page with link to the section via the Navigation bar menu
- The screen layout is for a pc screen and also an Iphone
- As seen on the full width screen, the "About Us" section is designed to read left and right with a statement about who we are and how we can work with you in the Middle
- On the Mobile phone screen all information falls to a vertical perspective with the About us sectiuon falling to the end [loving running Club-Ethos section]
- On the mobile image the Company statement with the focus on flow, floats to the left, but retains it animation of moving forward

# Site Structure
The static webpage is designed in three seperate informative sections, the Main image with animation circle to draw the attention of the User with the nav bar in the upper right hand corner. This Nav bar contains the  [Home](<#home>) which is underlined to let the user know what page they are currently on. Then followwd by the  [About-us](<#about-us>) which when clicked will bring the user to the middle of the page. In the About section in the middle there is a [Request Demo](<#request-demo>) whic will bring you to another page where the user will find a form, On completing this form the Submit button will be clicked which then will bring you to a reply page, And finally the [Contact-Us](<#contact-us>) which when clicked will bring you the the bottom section of the page with email link & map  direction link. This structure is drafted in the [Wireframes](<#wireframes>) Section

# Design Choice 

- ## Typography
For my project I decided to choose two fonts, Archivo as the text font and Roboto as the contrasting  heading font with a default font of Sans-Serif. 
* 'Archivo' The Reason I chose this contrasting style is because the reading  text is clear for the user to see. 
* 'Roboto' is used for the  heading text  which looks  solid prominent and straight, which i feel adds a nice contrast when the user is reading the page

## Color Scheme
For this project I decided on a traditional color scheme of b
