# HACCP-FLOW

## Welcome to <a href="https://peter-hennessy.github.io/HACCP-FLOW/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HACCP-FLOW</a> a digital food safety platform

The idea for my project comes from a business idea I am currently in the process of trying to create.
It is a cloud based digital food safety management system that is tailored to meet the needs of the individual.
The design I have decided to go with is a clean, clear, simplistic platform. Which is relatable to my company idea. 
The concept for my project is a company i am in the process of creating, It is a company concieved through my own work practices as a head head & market study with over 50 of my industry peers to design a cloud based digital food safety paltform
